## Lab 1 Basic Interconnected Network
## Objective 
Configure inter-network communications between two PC on separate subnets using static ip addressing and cisco router

### Topology
PC1--> SWITCH1 --> ROUTER --> PC2

### Steps used
1. Open the packet tracer and put two endpoint devices ie, Pc1,Pc2
2. To show case to how to connect 2 pc in different networks put a switch and router in between
3. Used cables to connect them as show in the topology 
4. Manually configured the 2 pcs with static ip address,gateway and subnet mask

| Device | IP address | Subnetmask     |  Gateway     |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|
|   PC1  |192.168.1.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1  |
|   PC2  |192.168.2.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.2.1  |

5. Router interfaces show red dots by default because they are administratively down and must be enabled manually using the no shutdown command.
6. Configured each router interface with ip address and subnet mask and enabled it on CLI.

```
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0 # to select which port needs to be configured
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 # static entry of ip address and subnetmask
no shutdown # manually turned on the port
exit
interface GigabitEthernet0/1 # to select which port needs to be configured
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0 # static entry of ip address and subnetmask
no shutdown # manually turned on the port
exit
```

### Key Observations
- Router interfaces do not automatically turn on.
- This is done by design -Routers are more complex devices and Cisco keeps interfaces shut by default to prevent unintended routing until it's explicitly configured.

### Verification
Ping from PC1 to PC2:
```
ping 192.168.2.10
Success rate is 100 percent (4/4)
```
